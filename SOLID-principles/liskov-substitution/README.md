# Example of Liskov Substitution principle

1. Check [Liskov substitution principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liskov_substitution_principle).
2. Check example_bad.js and example_good.js, and compare them. In this example, we show the class structure design that violates this principle and the class structure design that follows this principle.
3. Run the following
   - node example_bad.js
   - node example_good.js
