# Example of Bucket sort and Insertion sort

1. Check [Bucket sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bucket_sort) and [Insertion sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insertion_sort).
2. Check example.js.  In this example, we use Insertion sort in each bucket. This is fine when the bucket size is small. Otherwise, a different sorting algorithm should be used in the bucket.
3. Run the following
   - node example.js
